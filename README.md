#### Brief Description of Project - 
S.A.P Super is a supermarket located in Bihalpola Kurunegala. This organization was established
in 2018 and has since then strived to provide customers with products that fit their expectations.
Since 2018, the supermarket has tried its best to expand the business and provide a wider variety
of items and quality of life improvements to its customers, which is why, our client has come up
with addressing Operational issues as well as maintenance of its staff and identifying the growing
customer needs.
One of the main problems faced by the business is the lack of tracking of its inventory as many
items have been misplaced. Furthermore, item restocking has been slow and many items have not
been restocked in time, which leads to missed opportunities to make a profit. Certain items that
are currently missing from the store also need to be added in order to keep up with the growing
and changing consumer needs. The owner also wishes to have an understanding of the
performance of the supermarket as well as the performance of the staff employed.
The supermarket management system is a web-based application that allows the supermarket
owner to handle all supermarket activities online. The system comes equipped with an inventory
management system which has an automatic reordering functionality which makes the process of
restocking faster and more convenient. To add to this, the user of the system will be able to view
and access details regarding the movement of stock into and out of the business as well as view
any assets and expenses the business has incurred on a daily or monthly basis. Furthermore, the
system will come with the ability to calculate the net and gross profit of the business on a daily
basis which will help the client to access the business situation on a daily basis. The user can also
schedule promotions on certain items that the supermarket offers. The system will also provide
more promotions and added features to customers based on their loyalty to the business.
Inorder to manage the staff who involve directly with the business, a subsystem will be
implemented to manage and track staff. The owner will be able to directly view the staff, their
performance, salaries as well as update their information.
Moreover, the system can hold and will give a user to view previous customer and staff
complaints that were received by category and date, which will allow the owner and other parties
to keep track of customer and staff requirements. The system is hence a tool designed to improve
the running and profitability of the supermarket to its owners and staff.
